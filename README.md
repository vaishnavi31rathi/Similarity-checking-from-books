📚 Similarity Checking From Books 
🎯 Overview
An elegant text analysis project that explores the fascinating relationships between 64 literary works. Using sophisticated comparison algorithms, this project uncovers hidden patterns and similarities in classic literature.

✨ Key Features
Identifies the 100 most influential words across the literary corpus
Generates a comprehensive 64x64 similarity matrix
Reveals the top 10 most closely related book pairs
Processes and analyzes raw text with precision
Implements robust comparison algorithms

📊 Results Highlight
Our analysis revealed some fascinating connections between books. Here are some notable findings:

Gerard's Herbal volumes show remarkable similarity (91% match between Vol. 3 and Vol. 4)
Memoirs of Laetitia Pilkington demonstrates strong narrative consistency across volumes
Foxes Book of Martyrs maintains thematic coherence throughout different parts

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Core Components
Custom Book class for efficient text representation
Advanced text preprocessing pipeline
Sophisticated similarity calculation algorithms
Comprehensive word frequency analysis
Technology Stack
Language: C++
Data Format: Raw text files
Analysis Method: Statistical text comparison

📈 Performance
The program efficiently processes 64 books and performs:

Word frequency analysis across entire corpus
2,016 unique book-to-book comparisons
Similarity ranking and sorting

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository
Ensure all book text files are in the designated directory
Compile the C++ source files
Run the executable
Find results in the output directory
📝 Output Files
The program generates several output files:

common_words.txt: Top 100 most frequent words
similarity_matrix.txt: Complete comparison matrix
similar_books.txt: Top 10 most similar book pairs

💡 Technical Note
The current implementation uses a single-threaded approach to ensure maximum stability and reliability. While this design choice impacts processing speed, it guarantees consistent results across all system configurations.
